This directory contains scripts and segments of code mentioned in the slides during the R Stats Club presentation. Many examples follow[Nextflow's training resources](https://training.nextflow.io/basic_training), and exact links will be provided for each applicable code segment.

In order, we'll cover:

- [basic processes](https://github.com/metamaden/NextFlow-Workshop/blob/main/slides/basic_process.nf) with Nextflow
- [invoking R in a process](https://github.com/metamaden/NextFlow-Workshop/blob/main/slides/using_r_in_process.md)
- [constructing a workflow](https://github.com/metamaden/NextFlow-Workshop/blob/main/slides/workflow.nf)
