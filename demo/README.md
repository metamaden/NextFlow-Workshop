This directory contains code executed and created as part of the demo performed at the end of the R Stats Club presentation. Follow along [the demo script](https://github.com/metamaden/NextFlow-Workshop/blob/main/demo/run_demo.sh) to see how to run [rnaseq-nf](https://github.com/nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf) at [JHPCE](https://jhpce.jhu.edu/). We'll also modify [this script](https://github.com/nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf/blob/master/modules/multiqc/main.nf) in the original pipeline to create [a version with logs for MultiQC](https://github.com/metamaden/NextFlow-Workshop/blob/main/demo/modified_multiqc.nf).
